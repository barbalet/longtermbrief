## DESCRIPTION

This holds the reduced version of the ApeSDK primarily designed to produce a command line version with minimal additional processing.

Simulated Ape (formerly known as *Nervana* and *Noble Ape*) has been in development since 1996.

It features a number of autonomous simulation components including:

* landscape simulation, 
* biological simulation,
* weather simulation,
* sentient creature simulation (including a number of internal biological simulations), and,
* a simple intelligent-agent scripting language (ApeScript).

Build instructions can be found in /apesdk/BUILD.md

## CONTENTS

This project contains a concise version of the ApeSDK specially for other language ports. It has currently been used for providing a Python interface for the ApeSDK.
